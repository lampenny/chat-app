# Overview
📁 For maintainability, folder structure has been organized according to this project size. As a personal project, components & assets are in it’s own folders but the components have not been destructured further.

🖌 CSS selector naming uses the BEM methodology (https://en.bem.info/methodology/). Block followed by underscores and the element (e.g. channel-list__list__wrapper) then modifiers.

⚙️ Uses functional components with the three most important components being Channel Search, Team Channel List and Team Channel Preview.

📎 Built using 3 dependencies: stream-chat, stream-chat-react, universal-cookie.
